# Bio Implants: Pros and Cons

Ever since a friend of mine got a Bio implant in 2016, I've wanted one as well. There's different types, but the 2 main ones are NFC and RFID based. The time finally came in May 2019 at [Circle City Con](https://circlecitycon.com/), where there was a nurse from California who was offering to insert the [xEM RFID Chip](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xem/) for $60, which was the cheapest I had seen offered and I could do it in Indiana instead of going to the coasts where most certified nurses are. In my research, I saw that there were no Pros and Cons page I could find, so having my chip for over a year now, I decided to make one:

## Pros

### It's well documented

The xEM is one of the most well documented bio-implants out there, and the company Dangerous Things have been around for a long time, so I knew if I was going to get a bio-implant I'd want to go with them. Their site is pretty straight forward, and they're considered the standard when it comes to implants.

### It's cheap

Sure, cost is relative, and $60 isn't cheap for everyone. But as far as electronic equipment goes, I wouldn't call \$60 expensive. It's also a one time cost, plus the cost of a device to read and write the RFID values to the device. You can make one yourself using a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.deviceplus.com/raspberry-pi/integrate-rfid-module-raspberry-pi/) or [Arduino](https://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-Tag-Reading-and-Writing-TfCD-Project/) or use [this one off Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/125Khz-RFID-Reader-Writer-Compatible/dp/B07MBB29JT/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=rfid+reader&qid=1598398723&sr=8-4), note the Amazon one doesn't always read or write the first time, it doesn't have the best build quality, and can be found even cheaper on alibaba/aliexpress since it's a direct-from-china product.

### It's cool

If you're reading this, you're probably already interested in bio-implants as a technology. I think they're super cool, and definitely make for a fun conversation. You can use them to do some cool stuff too, although nothing a fingerprint scanner wouldn't be able to do.

### It's inconspicuous

I usually forget its there, and my friend who has one also forgets it's there. You would never know it's there except in one instance that's documented under the *Cons* section. 

## Cons

### It hurt

<u>A lot</u>. I was told it would be a 3-5 pain out of 10. It's injected using a needle with a large head (the implant is 2.1mm thick). With mine, I would say it was more like a 9/10 pain for about 30 seconds. After than, my thumb went numb for 5 minutes. Not the experience I was expecting. I was told for most people it's not like that, but from my single data point, it hurt quite a bit.

### It's not as useful as you'd think

This isn't a problem with the device, it's a problem with user (read: my) expectations and lack of research. You can't clone hotel cards or gym key fobs to this unless some specific hotel or gym use [weak RFID encryption methods](https://www.getkisi.com/blog/how-to-copy-access-cards-and-keyfobs). This is useful in home projects where you set up a system that only reads your RFID. On the xEM page linked above they have 3 example projects you could use it for, and there's always plenty to find on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/tag/rfid/), but its usefulness is something to keep in mind.

### It's noticeable in the gym

The only time I notice that I have a Bio-implant is when I'm working out. I go to the gym often, and that means pressing, gripping, or holding many bars, barbells, and dumbbells. after a long workout, my hand with the implant will be a bit more sore. It seems like a more tired grip, it's not painful though. I'd say it increases soreness in my left hand an extra 10% compared to my right hand without the implant. Pictures are included for reference:

# Conclusion

In the end, I think it's a cool little thing to have, but I'd wait to see if they can figure out how to put in an EMV chip so you could have a credit card in your hand. I think that use case alone would blow most others out of the water, and I would switch to that if it became reality.
