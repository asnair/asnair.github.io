# Scripts Sites and School

February already!

It's been just over a month since my last post. Don't be mistaken though, I currently have 4 articles waiting to edit including

1. Finding and fixing rouge 'smart' routers on an enterprise network
2. Installing and setting up the Skylines Project
3. Part 1 of the Fuzzing series
4. A long-form article about ethics in data collection, retention, and analysis.

Now you may be thinking that's a lot of articles to have waiting for editing and you'd be right; I enjoy writing, I do not enjoy editing. I'll avoid editing by writing the next article before I edit the older one. They'll get done, it just takes a bit of time.

In terms of project work, I've been working on various projects everyday, I'm just switching around often since I don't have time or energy to get very deep into a subject in the middle of winter and school. Some of the projects include:

- Various small scripts you can find on [my GitHub](https://github.com/asnair)
- Installing the [Skylines Project](https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines)
- Installing [FreePBX](https://www.freepbx.org/) (a VoIP phone server)
- Finishing the home lab (pictures coming soon!)
- Installing [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) (OSS ESXi VM management)
- Using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for a project that will be revealed in March
- Always messing around in Burp
- Learning [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and Python 3 (bye 2.7)
- Studying all the [hackaday projects](https://hackaday.io/projects) I want to do (my current to do projects)
- Studying for Security+, since I'll be taking it in March
- Maintenance on the [charity I run](https://thessf.org/) and filing to start an LLC, details in April

As you can imagine, I've been pretty busy! So busy that school is beginning to get neglected in a drop-all-projects type of way, so keep me in your thoughts as I pour down the coffee and neglect these projects for the next week while I get school back in order.

I'll also be attending [CypherCon](https://cyphercon.com/cyphercon-20/) in March, which will be my second convention ever, the first being [DerbyCon](https://www.derbycon.com/) last year. I'm always excited to go to the hacking cons, great to meet new people and have a great time in such a great atmosphere.

As far as the title of this post goes, we touched on the scripts and school. The sites part of the title involves finding a [very good deal from SSDNODES](https://www.ssdnodes.com/startup-specials/nyc/) which was a server with good specs for only $6/mo for life. I'll be migrating this site and the charity to said server shortly, and once I get Skylines installed it will also be on the server, as well as other services (probably mirrors or censorship-sensitive items) until I need the space. A very exciting occurrence, it's not everyday you get a new server.

Thanks for reading! I leave you with a picture you can send to your smart friends:
