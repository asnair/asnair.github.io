Using Skyline

Set up, hella problems:

crypto wheel again- fixed with reinstalling its dependencies, reinstalling it using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22073516/failed-to-install-python-cryptography-package-with-pip-and-setup-py

couldn't get dependcies for manage.py, ended up running it several times and installing every module it said it was missing

figuring out the INSTALL.md, which wasn't very accurate and left out a lot of what needed to be done
