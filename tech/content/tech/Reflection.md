# Reflection

Last week I almost died. By 'almost' I don't mean some stroke of luck saved me or that it was even that close. I was almost defibrillated as my heart rate stayed above 220 (where the machine stops counting) for awhile, but my body fixed itself after a little time.

I was unconscious for a few hours during this, but walked out of the South Indian hospital that day and traveled back to Singapore where I'm currently staying. There wasn't a huge chance of death, but there was *some* chance. Just enough chance that over the past week I've really been thinking about what I'm doing and where I'm going. It was one of those moments that make you evaluate where you're at. Has it been enough? Would I call my 21 years well spent? Who would have come (or not) to the wake and funeral? Am I ok with everything?

Those are very personal questions, but since this is a technical blog, I wanted to focus on the side of life involving study and work. I'm almost in my last year of university studying cybersecurity (as an [undergrad major](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/degrees/cybersecurity)!) and I've dedicated over 8 years of my life to working with computers, since I started [hacking video games at a young age.](https://gooddebate.org/2016/12/why-i-started-hacking/) In the security industry, and the IT industry as a whole, the mantra 'you can only succeed if you love it' is repeated until passion becomes your middle name. Starting so young, I had a lot of time to devote to technology and thought most people spent most of their time on their work.

$I never understood how people ended up in careers they weren't interested in until I got to university. 

$That's when I realized this mantra is fairly specific to IT and development. No other industry expects its workers to spend their free time and energy learning more and improving their abilities in regards to work related technology. Engineers for the most part don't go home and do equations in their free time. Businessmen don't go home and write business plans for fake businesses they never plan on starting. But IT/dev workers go home and build/learn tools that often are used at work; for students, you work in your free time to show what you can do outside the classroom. I love working in tech and especially security every single day, but I've wondered if part of the reason I love it is because growing up I heard that was normal. This hit me even more when I saw this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every person must find or have three hobbies:<br><br>1. One to make you money ðŸ’° <br><br>2. One to keep you in great shape.<br><br>3. One to keep you creative.<br><br>Your turn now. Donâ€™t be shy. What are you passionate about?</p>&mdash; nixCraft: The Best Linux Blog In the Unixverse (@nixcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/972675328148570113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2018</a></blockquote>

And I realized my #1 and #3 are essentially the same thing. And if there was a way to do #2 working on a computer directly, I'd probably be doing that as well. This is conflicting because to do great things takes a lot of work, and in the common mantra, working on great things requires sacrifice. I've always heard that doing something like starting a company requires giving up #2 and #3, especially when school takes so much time it can seem like there's no time to sleep or eat, of which I've given up a lot of both. But is it worth it? And is so much sacrifice required? When someone brings these points up a lot of people will say that it's all possible, that you can do #1-3 and still run a company and do school and have time for friends and family and alone time. Maybe it is, but I definitely haven't figured it out. Looking back, I'm starting to regret the amount of time I've spent learning about coding and computers instead of being outside playing more soccer and basketball with friends. I've come a long way and would say I'm fairly secure in the job market in terms of opportunity, but in security it seems you turn away for a week and you're a month behind. It doesn't seem right, but it isn't my call to change it yet, nor would I know how to change it.

Technology is often criticized because there are <u>a lot</u> of anti-social people in tech, but considering so many companies and universities push the 'code or die' mantra even when you're outside class or work, what is the root cause of the anti-social behavior? Do anti-socials join tech or does tech cause anti-socials? Of course there's no clear answers either way, but looking at my own life, I believe the technology field causes people to become more anti-social over time, primarily through implicitly requiring complete dedication even on one's own time. It's a constant battle to not sink into anti-social behavior by actively remembering to step away from the computer. It just seems there is so much to do that a student could work and never make it. And while it is important to work hard, looking back now I'm increasingly unhappy with how hard I've worked. What I'm more unhappy about, however, is that I'll continue working very hard for the next few years. I can't just stop now or even cut down. The pressure of the industry doesn't disappear when you realize it's there. But over time, I hope tech 'normalizes' in a way, compared to other industries. **In the future, I hope tech does a better job with work/life balance. I hope in interviews there are more questions about a balanced life as a human being and less about straight technical skill. I hope employers make employees take time off, including both for charity work and for personal time.** These 3 changes could make a huge difference across the industry if employers took them seriously. I believe interns get a good preview of the best parts a company has to offer, and even the best companies I've been to can always improve in this area.

In the meantime, I'll still be working hard. At this point I don't feel right when I'm not being productive. Maybe I'm part of the problem and perpetuate the constant work harder and longer idealism. But for now, back to traveling. I'll still feel bad about not working as much while studying abroad, but maybe I can break the work habit a little.

*Note: I'm still traveling and won't be publishing again until May at the earliest. I'm seeing South East Asia and the work I do currently isn't necessarily technical, and therefore doesn't belong on this blog. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_snair) for random thoughts.
