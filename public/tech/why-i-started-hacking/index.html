  <h1 id="why-i-started-hacking">Why I started hacking</h1>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d write this because of the number of questions I get about how I got started hacking, so here&rsquo;s the story:</p>
<p>*<strong>Note: infosec and cybersecurity are used interchangeably.</strong></p>
<p>I started &lsquo;hacking&rsquo; when I was 12 years old. I got an Xbox 360 the year before, and loved playing Call of Duty. After about a year, it started getting a little boring, but one day I joined a random game, which happened to be a &lsquo;10th prestige lobby&rsquo;, or a hacked lobby. I remember being so amazed as everyone flew through the air with infinite health and ammo, doing all kinds of things I&rsquo;d never thought about, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLAu44Qct2g">shooting jet airplanes into the ground</a>. It only lasted about 5 minutes, but I got to see hacking for the first time. I decided I wanted to make my own hacked lobby so I could do it whenever I wanted.</p>
<p>There were a few challenges to overcome in the beginning. When I was 12 years old, I was actually behind on technology. I read a lot of books, but didn&rsquo;t use computers very much, and didn&rsquo;t know basics like what a web browser actually was. The only thing I knew about computers was I could google questions, and Wikipedia knew everything. These are still my primary tools, which I try to emphasize to people when they ask about how hacking actually works.</p>
<p>So for the first few months, I got caught up in technology. I entered the rabbit hole, starting with the question <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?s=d&amp;q=How+to+hack+call+of+duty">&lsquo;how to hack Call of Duty&rsquo;</a>. I learned what the internet was in practical terms, learned about electricity and programming and what a computer was doing when you go online. But most importantly, I learned how to google. I learned how to find information quickly, and this is by far the most important skill I believe everyone should have, but very few actually do. There&rsquo;s an art to knowing how to word questions, scan fast, and find information quickly. Considering the tens to hundreds of questions I google everyday, finding information quickly is essential. If your starting in any field, learn how to find information quickly first.</p>
<h5 id="trouble">Trouble</h5>
<p>About a year after endeavoring into making a hacked lobby, I finally did so, only to get banned a week later for hacking. Go figure. At the time, I thought I was going to get in trouble with the police, so I actually stopped for awhile. When you&rsquo;re 13, you don&rsquo;t want to get in trouble whatsoever, and I was scared. Some time later, probably only a few months, Anonymous started getting in the news as they hacked several institutions. One report in particular grabbed my attention, about the tool they used called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon">Low Orbit Ion Cannon</a>. The LOIC is a ddos tool they used to take down some major websites. Just the name sounded so cool, I wanted an ion cannon too, so I jumped on google and downloaded the first app I could find. As it turned out, it was a Trojan, and I started getting ads everywhere. Go figure. But from there I knew I had to learn more. Everything involving computers was on the internet. I could do everything the professionals do right from my desk. All the information about hacking, the internet, malware, programming, it was all there. The rest is history, and 8 years later I&rsquo;m going strong. What I really love about cybersecurity is the accessibility of everything. You can be at the level of the best professionals with enough time and practice, enough researching. I don&rsquo;t believe cybersecurity, or any field for that matter, depends on talent. I firmly believe interest and hard work are what makes someone an expert in what they do. People think I&rsquo;m naturally good with computers, but they don&rsquo;t see the years of work I&rsquo;ve put in to get to where I am. If you work on something multiple hours a day for years, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible you won&rsquo;t be at least decent at it.</p>
<p>I got my first internship when I was 16 as a programmer in VB.NET, which was my best language considering 90% of the malware on hackforums is VB.NET, which is where I learned both about malware and programming from. I always joke about it because I didn&rsquo;t have my driver&rsquo;s license so my parents had to drive me to the interview.</p>
<p>So if this story has inspired you to <del>pick up a book</del> start googling, the next post will have some tips and resources that helped me to get from 0 to where I am now, an 1337 Ã¼ber hax0r ready to hack all things. Or just someone who loves tech, that&rsquo;s cool too.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
