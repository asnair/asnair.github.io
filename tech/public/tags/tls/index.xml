      <description>Announcing the Strategic Intelligence Network, TLS, and Banned Ebooks Note: you can find the SIN and BEb on the menu in the lower left As promised (and implemented roughly 2 weeks ago), this site now services all direct content through TLS using Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. The implementation was surprisingly easy, although I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a quick guide on their site, digitalocean had a very easy and quick 5 minute installation. Some images are still over http, but I&amp;rsquo;m not as concerned about that at the moment, and will spend that small amount of effort elsewhere.</description>
