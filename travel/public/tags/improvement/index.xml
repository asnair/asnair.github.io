      <description>A week without work So last week was spring break, and I travelled to sunny southern Florida without my computer or phone. This was the first time since I started working on computers 8 years ago that I&amp;rsquo;ve gone without it for more than a day or two.
 It was an experience, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it again.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve gone without my phone for over a month before, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind.</description>

      <title>Improving the School System</title>

      <description>Improving the School System I recently came across an essay I wrote my senior year in high school entitled &amp;ldquo;How to improve the educational system&amp;rdquo;. This is one of the longest essays I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written at 5400 words, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for a class. I wrote the paper because I felt it would help improve the system if the right people read it. It was well received and made its way up the ladder, unfortunately not much came of it.</description>
