# Welcome to my new travel blog!

This blog started as a technical blog in 2015, and the main page of Good Debate is still just that. In the past few years I've begun travelling internationally, and have now been to 48 US states and 27 countries accross Europe and East Asia. This travel blog will be a collection of thoughts on travelling and how I manage to travel so much on a budget.

I travelled to Puerto Rico a month ago and will be visiting Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru in January, so expect content related to those travels in 2020.

This announcement also comes with a site redesign, which will be explained on the [tech side](https://gooddebate.org) of this site.

Thanks for reading, and safe travels.
