      <description>Python Development Environment I set out to create an extensible, portable python development that would be consistent if I moved it between operating environments and architectures. When I first set out on this project, I wanted to use Docker to deploy a dev environment on top of a Debian based system. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize this when I started, nor did Google seem to know that Docker isn&amp;rsquo;t meant for a dev environment, only for pushing about apps after they&amp;rsquo;re made.</description>

      <description>This post was originally going to be about how to set up a few different systems, including vagrant, docker, ansible, and some random python projects on debian/ubuntu systems, but I ran into a singular problem on almost everything I did. The error was always
