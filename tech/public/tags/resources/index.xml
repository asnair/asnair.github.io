      <description>Scripts Sites and School February already!
It&amp;rsquo;s been just over a month since my last post. Don&amp;rsquo;t be mistaken though, I currently have 4 articles waiting to edit including
 Finding and fixing rouge &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; routers on an enterprise network Installing and setting up the Skylines Project Part 1 of the Fuzzing series A long-form article about ethics in data collection, retention, and analysis.  Now you may be thinking that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of articles to have waiting for editing and you&amp;rsquo;d be right; I enjoy writing, I do not enjoy editing.</description>
