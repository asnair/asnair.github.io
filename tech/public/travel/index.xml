      <description>If you want to hack (all the things) In my last post, I told my story about how I started hacking. Hopefully that made you want to learn too, so I made the honorary &amp;lsquo;How to start hacking&amp;rsquo; post.

      <description>Welcome! This blog has been revamped using Hugo, a static site generator. Keep an eye out for all things hacking. Mostly offensive, sometimes defensive if I know how to fix things that are broken. You can find me on twitter and github, and can read about me some on the about page. Thanks for checking out the blog!
