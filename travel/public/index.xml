      <description>Welcome to my new travel blog! This blog started as a technical blog in 2015, and the main page of Good Debate is still just that. In the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve begun travelling internationally, and have now been to 48 US states and 27 countries accross Europe and East Asia. This travel blog will be a collection of thoughts on travelling and how I manage to travel so much on a budget.</description>
