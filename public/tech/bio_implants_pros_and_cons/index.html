  <h1 id="bio-implants-pros-and-cons">Bio Implants: Pros and Cons</h1>
<p>Ever since a friend of mine got a Bio implant in 2016, I&rsquo;ve wanted one as well. There&rsquo;s different types, but the 2 main ones are NFC and RFID based. The time finally came in May 2019 at <a href="https://circlecitycon.com/">Circle City Con</a>, where there was a nurse from California who was offering to insert the <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/product/xem/">xEM RFID Chip</a> for $60, which was the cheapest I had seen offered and I could do it in Indiana instead of going to the coasts where most certified nurses are. In my research, I saw that there were no Pros and Cons page I could find, so having my chip for over a year now, I decided to make one:</p>
<p>Quick side note, none of these links are affiliate links and I make no money off this blog.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<h3 id="its-well-documented">It&rsquo;s well documented</h3>
<p>The xEM is one of the most well documented bio-implants out there, and the company Dangerous Things have been around for a long time, so I knew if I was going to get a bio-implant I&rsquo;d want to go with them. Their site is pretty straight forward, and they&rsquo;re considered the standard when it comes to implants.</p>
<h3 id="its-cheap">It&rsquo;s cheap</h3>
<p>Sure, cost is relative, and $60 isn&rsquo;t cheap for everyone. But as far as electronic equipment goes, I wouldn&rsquo;t call $60 expensive. It&rsquo;s also a one time cost, plus the cost of a device to read and write the RFID values to the device. You can make one yourself using a <a href="https://www.deviceplus.com/raspberry-pi/integrate-rfid-module-raspberry-pi/">Raspberry Pi</a> or <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/RFID-Tag-Reading-and-Writing-TfCD-Project/">Arduino</a> or use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/125Khz-RFID-Reader-Writer-Compatible/dp/B07MBB29JT/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=rfid+reader&amp;qid=1598398723&amp;sr=8-4">this one off Amazon</a>, note the Amazon one doesn&rsquo;t always read or write the first time, it doesn&rsquo;t have the best build quality, and can be found even cheaper on alibaba/aliexpress since it&rsquo;s a direct-from-china product.</p>
<h3 id="its-cool">It&rsquo;s cool</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re probably already interested in bio-implants as a technology. I think they&rsquo;re super cool, and definitely make for a fun conversation. You can use them to do some cool stuff too, although nothing a fingerprint scanner wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do.</p>
<h3 id="its-inconspicuous">It&rsquo;s inconspicuous</h3>
<p>I usually forget its there, and my friend who has one also forgets it&rsquo;s there. You would never know it&rsquo;s there except in one instance that&rsquo;s documented under the <em>Cons</em> section.</p>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<h3 id="it-hurt">It hurt</h3>
<p><u>A lot</u>. I was told it would be a 3-5 pain out of 10. It&rsquo;s injected using a needle with a large head (the implant is 2.1mm thick). With mine, I would say it was more like a 9/10 pain for about 30 seconds. After than, my thumb went numb for 5 minutes. Not the experience I was expecting. I was told for most people it&rsquo;s not like that, but from my single data point, it hurt quite a bit.</p>
<h3 id="its-not-as-useful-as-youd-think">It&rsquo;s not as useful as you&rsquo;d think</h3>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a problem with the device, it&rsquo;s a problem with user (read: my) expectations and lack of research. You can&rsquo;t clone hotel cards or gym key fobs to this unless some specific hotel or gym use <a href="https://www.getkisi.com/blog/how-to-copy-access-cards-and-keyfobs">weak RFID encryption methods</a>. This is useful in home projects where you set up a system that only reads your RFID. On the xEM page linked above they have 3 example projects you could use it for, and there&rsquo;s always plenty to find on <a href="https://hackaday.com/tag/rfid/">Hackaday</a>, but its usefulness is something to keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="its-noticeable-in-the-gym">It&rsquo;s noticeable in the gym</h3>
<p>The only time I notice that I have a Bio-implant is when I&rsquo;m working out. I go to the gym often, and that means pressing, gripping, or holding many bars, barbells, and dumbbells. after a long workout, my hand with the implant will be a bit more sore. It seems like a more tired grip, it&rsquo;s not painful though. I&rsquo;d say it increases soreness in my left hand an extra 10% compared to my right hand without the implant. Pictures are included for reference:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the end, I think it&rsquo;s a cool little thing to have, but I&rsquo;d wait to see if they can figure out how to put in an EMV chip so you could have a credit card in your hand. I think that use case alone would blow most others out of the water, and I would switch to that if it became reality.</p>
